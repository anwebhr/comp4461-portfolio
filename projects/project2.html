                            With the advent of wearables and smartwatches in the digital consumer products realm, 
                            consumers have been captivated by the Apple Watch series and Fitbits. Millenials in particular 
                            are employing wearables in their daily activities, covering most functions that a smartphone can. 
                            Exercise is a particular area that we felt <b>smartwatches</b> trump over smartphones, as they can capture certain 
                            vitals that phones cannot, like pulse metrics.
                            <br>
                            Looking at these aspects that help smartwatch users exercise better, we decided to interview a handful of users 
                            around campus. University students are an example section of the population that use such wearables and understanding 
                            what they look at when exercising or what attracted them to use a smartwatch was what we seeked to gain from meeting them.
                            <center><img style="display: inline;" class="img-responsive" src="../img/interview_1.png" alt="" width="70%" height="70%" /></center>
                            <br>
                            We interviewed a bunch of students with wearables but in the interest of time and repetition of viewpoints, we 
                            show 3 interviews in our POV video (scroll to bottom of page to view).
                            <br>
                            Sample questions we asked our interviewees: 
                            <br>1. Do you like using your wearable? How satisfied are you with it?
                            <br>2. What vitals or metrics do you track when exercising?
                            <br>3. What do you think is missing?
                            <br><br>
                            
                            <center><img style="display: inline;" class="img-responsive" src="../img/survey_1.png" alt="" width="70%" height="70%" /></center>
                            <br>
                            <center><img style="display: inline;" class="img-responsive" src="../img/survey_2.png" alt="" width="70%" height="70%" /></center>
                            <br>
                            To get more opinions and views across campus, I created an open survey for HKUST students to fill that asked about their exercising habits, their interest 
                            in wearable technology and their assessment of the information it shows them when they work out. Interestingly, 
                            only around 6 of our 31 respondents use wearables currently, although many people expressed interest but haven't the right 
                            product for themselves yet. <br>
                            - A majority of these respondents (around 85%) believe that wearables either show the right amount of stats or 
                            show too many stats. <br>
                            - A majority of these respondents (around 66%) believe that wearables do not help them know when they get tired while working out.

                        <div>
                            <br>
                            After noting down our observations and users' comments and views on wearables, our team set out to collate, 
                            organise and understand what problems we could address.
                            <br><br>
                            <center><img style="display: inline;" class="img-responsive" src="../img/ideation_1.png" alt="" width="70%" height="70%"/> </center><br>
                            <center><img style="display: inline;" class="img-responsive" src="../img/ideation_2.png" alt="" width="70%" height="70%"/> </center>
                            <br><br>
                            Dividing our points into comments, concerns and ideas we figured out that most users using a smartwatch while working out 
                            found that they had to go through a lot of steps to assess their physical status, for example to time their workout or to check their 
                            calories burnt and then calculate in their heads if it was enough for the session. Most of them mentioned that it would be good to know 
                            if they were reaching their goals or how tired they were.
                            <br>
                            As extrapolating levels of tiredness was a very common point most interviewees mentioned as a concern, 
                            we conceptualised a few possible solutions:
                            <br>1. Showing the user if he/she has reached their custom set target
                            <br>2. Combining a couple of metrics to give a one-look fatigue indicator
                            <br>2. Show heart rate as an indicator of biological metabolism and in turn, fatigue.
                            <br>
                        </div>
                    </div>

                        <div>
                            <br>
                            To better understand how our users may go about reaching their goal to knowing when they are tired, 
                            I created a Goals Operators Methods Selection Model to visualise the workflow of a user's exercise routine 
                            without the aid of a Fitbit, with a hypothetical fatigue indicator, and with a heart rate monitor.
                            <br><br>

                            <br>
                            Understanding our target users is as important as designing the right product, hence I went forth to create User Personas to 
                            help our team agree with what qualities and motivations we should look for in our target population. In the below personas 
                            we wanted to capture both wearable-savvy people as well as people uncomfortable with wearables because of their complexity. <br><br>
                            <i>Aiming to attract health-conscious young individuals, we set out to design a wristband that would be easy and intuitive to use 
                            requiring the user to employ <b>recognition over recall</b>. </i>

                        <div>
                            <br>
                            A storyboard helps put across an ideal usage scenario of the proposed product. I created a storyboard with a female athletic character exercising 
                            at HKUST Track and Field and using her fatigue indicator to assess and work out efficiently. It may not be very evident from the scan of the storyboard 
                            below, but in the story the character looks out for different colours indicating different levels of energy left for example green for good, yellow for 
                            okay levels and red for time to stop.
                            <br><br>
                            <center><img style="display: inline;" class="img-responsive" src="../img/storyboard.jpg" alt="" width="70%" height="70%" /></center><br>
                            <br>
                            Before speed dating with our potential users with the storyboard, we agreed that giving our team a look-and-feel of the product would 
                            greatly aid their assessment and validation of our idea. Considering that a smartwatch cannot be emulated using a paper prototype, we built our 
                            crude smartwatch low fidelity prototype using a rubber wristband and a couple of LED lights. We wanted to give the user the feeling that the product 
                            we were offering them isn't too fancy and glaringly intuitive to use without the fuss of dials or figures or complex programs.

                            that emulates certain parameters like calories burnt, step count, weight, heart rate, age, elapsed time etc. We changed these parameters and using estimates 
                            to determine the effect on the user's fatigue levels, we displayed a different hue of light each for good, moderate and diminished energy levels as well as 
                            insomnia and dehydration. As it is difficult to program a wearable and our team has no experience programming LEDs using technologies like Arduino, we didn't 
                            program our lo-fi prototype as we didn't want to invest as much time in the design stage as the process of learning would have entailed.

                                Now that we had our storyboard and lo-fi prototype to show to our users, we asked a few students what their opinions were 
                                on our designs, and what suggestions they might have for us.
                                <br><br>

                                Our users gave us an overall positive response, describing our product as <i>not complex, pertinent, convenient to use as one can get their 
                                information quickly without having to read and understand numbers on a screen</i>. Some key suggestions for improvement we received were:
                                <br>1. to allow the user for customisation of colours on the device according to the users' taste
                                <br>2. to allow integration with smartphone to receive statistics.

                                Our team as a whole, if I can speak for my team, enjoyed the POV process as it gave us an opportunity to explore an upcoming market and 
                                empathize with users problems and try addressing their needs. We started with aiming to apply light to a more unique area and although wearables 
                                may not be a very conventional realm, it is nevertheless an important aspect of millenials' daily lives. We realised along the process that 
                                sometimes in the quest of loading smartwatches with as much information as much as possible, some tech companies might forget that in some situations 
                                the simpler solutions are often the best, and our product is a step towards an efficient technologically savvy world.
