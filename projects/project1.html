                            <br><br>
                            Given that the user would want to read my portfolio the same way he may read my resume,
                            I decided to incorporate a one-page smooth scrolling experience for easier interaction.
                            Keeping every section's link available at the navigation bar helps the user
                            jump from section to section as he wishes.
                            There is a landing page with a stock photo as background to indicate creativity and a 
                            bit of nerdiness, scrolling after which leads to a section introducing myself with some 
                            background information.
                            <br><br>
                            <center><img style="display: inline;" class="img-responsive" src="../img/lofi_2.png" alt="" width="70%" height="70%" /></center>
                            <center><img style="display: inline;" class="img-responsive" src="../img/lofi_3.png" alt="" width="70%" height="70%" /></center>
                            <br><br>
                            I decided to introduce the 3 projects as cards, to deliver the information at first glance
                            in bite-sixed chunks. Each card would have a photo pertaining to the project topic, the topic 
                            title overlaying the photo to help make that association and attract the user to read the topics. A brief description of the project 
                            is provided in the right side of the card with a button below that leads to a page *like this* 
                            for a detailed diary and report of the experience.<br>
                            The last section was to contact me, where the user could download a copy of my resume for 
                            a more formal record of what I've done on a printer-friendly page and obtain my contact details
                            from the same.
                            <br><br>
                            <center><img style="display: inline;" class="img-responsive" src="../img/lofi_4.png" alt="" width="70%" height="70%" /></center>
                            <br><br>
                            When the user clicks on the More Info button, he will be greeted by a popup that blacks out the
                            the outer portions of the screen and pops up a window with the project diary. This, in Bootstrap
                            is called a modal. The reason why I wanted to pursue this format of display was that when the user
                            clicks on the blackened out corners of the page, the modal will be closed immediately and the window
                            brought back to the initial Project cards section, leading to faster transition to other project details
                            pages without leaving that page.<br>
                            The page will have a vertical divider and the left section will be a copy of the project card but vertical,
                            to provide a short-term association to the project card seen before. The left column will remain fixed on the 
                            screen as the user scrolls through the right column, so that the user is reminded the whole time what the project is about. The right column is made flexible to be designed according to 
                            what I want to highlight about the project.
                        </div>
                            
                    </div>
                    <div class="row">
                        <br><br>
                        <h3 style="padding: 10px;"class="footer-title"> Stage 2: High Fidelity Prototype</h3>
                        <div>
                            <br><br>
                            On adding more visual details and brainstorming more, there a couple of changes I made to the 
                            lo-fi wireframe shown above. These changes are discussed as below, along with the design considerations
                            I had in mind.
                            <br><br>
                            <center><img style="display: block;" class="img-responsive" src="../img/hifi_1.png" alt="" width="70%" height="70%"/> </center>
                            <br><br>
                            The navigation bar had been fixed at the top position of the window, so that when the user scrolls through 
                            the page, the navbar stays at the top so that the user can move to any section as he wishes.
                            The colour scheme chosen for the page is white (#f8f8f8) and dark blue (#34495e) for contrasting
                            each section of the webpage. I have incorporated a good amount of white space in my webpage to help
                            give the page a clean and minimalist look.
                            <br><br>
                            <center><img style="display: inline;" class="img-responsive" src="../img/hifi_2.png" alt="" width="70%" height="70%" /></center>
                            <br><br>
                            The most visible difference as compared to the lo-fi design is the Skill Set section I added later.
                            I introduced this section to provide the user with an overview of my strengths and abilities. 
                            I used Radial Charts by Izzy Skye using her Codepen as a template. The longer the bar, the higher the 
                            skill level for each skill mentioned. The reason I didn't use a normal linear bar graph was that the radial bar 
                            graphs I have made for each skill category (Technical, Soft, Personal) are similar in shape; also there is a repetition 
                            of colours (#18bc9c, #6495ed, #daa520) thus incorporating the Gestalt Theory.<br>
                            To put the Hermann Ebbinghaus law into effect, the recency effect dictates that the user keeps my personal skills in 
                            mind in his short term memory while he reads through the pages and the primary effect mandates that the user 
                            keep my technical skills in his long term memory, all in a bid to appear more attractive for a job. 
                            <br><br>
                            <center><img style="display: inline;" class="img-responsive" src="../img/hifi_3.png" alt="" width="70%" height="70%" /></center>
                            <br><br>
                            I decided to remove the Resume button as in today's technically savvy world, users may want to visit my 
                            online profiles on platforms like Github (being a programmer), LinkedIn, Facebook, or simply email. I 
                            haven't added any section heading as the social media buttons are intuitive enough for the user to guess what 
                            they are for. The buttons have been grouped together and are enclosed in that section to account for heuristics.
                            <br> The main colour scheme is dark blue to convey trust and dependability on a potential to get the job done, and bright green 
                            to convey excitement and the growth prospects if choosing to work with me. The buttons also revert colour when hovered on for added 
                            interaction.
                            <br><br>
                            <center><img style="display: inline;" class="img-responsive" src="../img/color_1.png" alt="" width="70%" height="70%" /></center><br>
                            <center><img style="display: inline;" class="img-responsive" src="../img/color_2.png" alt="" width="70%" height="70%" /></center><br>

                            <br><br>
                            To make the page <b>colour blind friendly</b>, I ensured that the colours used on my page, for 
                            the buttons and radial charts were distinguishable upto a good extent for all kinds of colour-blindness. 
                            The colour in the circle for each picture indicates what the colour looks like to normal people, and
                            the colours in the rectangles indicate what that colour looks like for each disorder.
                            <br><br>
                            <center><img style="display: inline;" class="img-responsive" src="../img/hifi_4.png" alt="" width="70%" height="70%" /></center><br>
                            <br>
                            Assuming what the user's eyeball scan path will be like, the project details page encourages the user to 
                            to read the project title and brief description first and then notice the goals achieved and areas of improvement to 
                            provide a crisp and concise overview of the project.

                                The process of creating the website itself was not short of challenges.
                                I decided to not wholly depend on a Bootstrap template from the web, instead work out the HTML/CSS 
                                myself so that I can improve my front-end skills further, and customise the page the way I want to 
                                show it.
                                <br>
                                I used Andrea Galanti's Flatly theme for its smooth transitions and animation effects, Izzy Skye's 
                                Radial charts for the skill set display, Pexels for stock photos and flaticons.com for icons.
                                <br><br>
                                <center><img style="display: inline;" class="img-responsive" src="../img/challenge_1.png" alt="" width="70%" height="70%" /></center><br>
                                <br>
                                The major challenge I faced was to render the radial charts for the skill sets 
                                correctly. As in the above picture, for quite a while there was a bug that didn't render the % skill views, instead covered 360 degrees 
                                of the chart. The reason why it wasn't displaying properly was that there was a parent div tag above whose 
                                css display property hindered with the chart's display. I fixed this by navigating through the code to the top layers and 
                                modifying the code to make it compatible for my charts while not losing on the overall look and feel of the 
                                website.
                                <br><br>
                                <center><img style="display: inline;" class="img-responsive" src="../img/challenge_2.png" alt="" width="70%" height="70%" /></center><br>
                                The idea of using a modal for displaying the project details didn't work out as usually, for smaller content modals are a great way to 
                                display additional information. I realised that my project details page may need more space than a modal could offer that would improve readability. 
                                Hence it came down to choosing certain benefits over others. For fun I tried inserting content into a modal but surprisingly some incompatibility in 
                                my code caused it to be rendered as above, with the whole screen's opacity reduced, and no option to get back to the main page (yes, my page got stuck!).
                                <br><br>
                                Another difficulty was to fix the left column of this page while keeping the right column scrollable. This layout has its limitations if this 
                                page were to be multi-sectioned as the left column may overflow into the other sections as well. As the project details page isn't meant to have 
                                multiple sections as it describes only one project, the situation fit fine to what I was trying to achieve with the project page.

                                <br><br>
                                To sum it up, I felt I got to learn a lot about user experience considerations and web design and development along the way.
                                I'm glad I was able to achieve my goals and implement alternate solutions when faced with obstacles.
