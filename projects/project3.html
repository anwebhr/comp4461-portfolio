                            It is no surprise that artificial intelligence has become ubiquitous enough to enter our lives, whether it 
                            be through machines performing human-comparable feats in the medical industry, Amazon picking the right product 
                            for us to buy, or Siri following our every command. The applications of AI don't just stop there. Physical robots are no 
                            longer a part of fiction and are used in retail and entertainment. Being students of the University of Science and Technology 
                            encouraged us to employ such a robot on campus to help make some processes better.
                            <br>
                            To get a first hand account of what kind of problems students and staff might be facing, we decided to interview 
                            a handful of users around campus. Gathering their views on robots, AI and aspects of student life was what we 
                            seeked to gain from meeting them.
                            <br>
                            We interviewed a bunch of students but in the interest of time and repetition of viewpoints, we 
                            show 2 interviews in our POV video <i>(scroll to bottom of page to view)</i>.
                            <br>
                            Some areas we explored with our interviewees: 
                            <br>1. Their previous interaction with a robot if any and how their experience was
                            <br>2. Their general views on AI
                            <br>3. Any problems they faced on campus that particularly annoyed them more than any other
                            <br>4. Any suggestions on how a robot could be used
                            <br>5. What they looked for in such an assistant
                            <br><br>
                            <center><img style="display: inline;" class="img-responsive" src="../img/group_ideas_1.png" alt="" width="70%" height="70%" /></center>

                            <br>
                            
                            We then tokenized our observations and grouped them together to collate users' concerns, the attributes the robot should have, 
                            the scenarios that it can be used in, etc.<br>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="row">

                            <br>
                            From our interview responses, we built a mindmap to get a clearer focus on what concrete ideas we could explore, keeping the users' considerations in mind.
                            <br>The following are the three main ideas we felt stood out the most:<br>
                            1. A robot that takes your coffee orders while you wait in line to pay <br>
                            2. A robot that helps authenticate you when you enter your residential hall <br>
                            3. A robot that can conduct lectures and read out materials (because some interviewees felt some of their professors drone like a robot)<br>
                            <i>Disclaimer: This is purely an opinion of some of our interviewees. I do love some of my professors' content delivery styles! </i>

                            <br>
                            We identified our <b>goals</b> to be:<br>
                            - To improve an aspect of campus life <br>
                            - To create a simple user experience, for amateurs and robot enthusiasts alike <br>
                            - To perform a necessary and useful task impacting most students and/or staff <br>
                            - To develop an efficient solution to the problem we choose to tackle
                            <br><br>
                            <center><img style="display: inline;" class="img-responsive" src="../img/process_step1.png" alt="" width="70%" height="70%" /></center><br>
                            <center><img style="display: inline;" class="img-responsive" src="../img/process_step2.png" alt="" width="70%" height="70%" /></center><br>
                            Understanding the context of the problem involves getting to know the current process firsthand, then think about improvements to this.
                            Getting stuck waiting in a line for one's coffee is pretty uneventful, so are observing lectures, but hall entry is a process we wanted to research on.  
                            Bruce took a video of him entering his residential hall and as the two photos above show, it is a 2 step process: <br>
                            Step 1: Tap/insert your student card outside the hall entrance. <br>
                            Step 2A: The hall attendant/guard verifies your face with that on the card you just tapped. <br>
                            OR<br>
                            Step 2B: The hall guard asks you to insert your card in a scanner that displays the cardholder's details and face to the guard for verification. <br>
                            <br><br>
                            <center><img style="display: inline;" class="img-responsive" src="../img/hall_goms.png" alt="" width="70%" height="70%" /></center>
                            We developed a GOMS process to put down this process in more excruciating detail and imagine where to put the robot such that it made the process 
                            more efficient for residents and visitors alike. <br><br>
                            <center><img style="display: inline;" class="img-responsive" src="../img/hall_persona.png" alt="" width="70%" height="70%" /></center>
                            We also created a User Persona to understand what the students would look for in a solution, what actually might motivate them towards their goals and what 
                            hinders them from achieving their objectives. <br><br>
                            <center><img style="display: inline;" class="img-responsive" src="../img/brainstorm.png" alt="" width="70%" height="70%" /></center><br>
                            After this we brainstormed again to put on the board points to consider for each of the 3 shortlisted scenarios and went ahead to create storyboards for the same.

                        <div>
                            <br>
                            A storyboard helps put across an ideal usage scenario of the proposed product. We created 3 storyboards to show a robot hall guard, a robot order-assistant,
                             and a "robot professor". Drawing out the robot professor storyboard just reaffirmed my sarcasm in including this as a solution!

                                on our designs, and what suggestions they might have for us. The video has just one interviewee shown as in our other interview our team member by mistake 
                                forgot to press record while I conducted the interview.

                                <br>
                                Our users gave us an overall positive response, and mentioned that:
                                1. the professor idea was hilarious but impractical (as we expected), yet could do okay if machine learning was to be used for intelligent responses.
                                2. the cafe order robot assistant was good, but would be better if the robot could remember users' preferences, or top picks using facial recognition to associate users 
                                with faces.
                                3. the hall guard system was the best of the lot. It would make things faster as they just have to look at the robot to be granted
                                 access but may hinder people who may want to sneak into the hall after-hours, however we weren't concerned with this as we like staying on the 
                                 good side of the law!

                                    We chose Pepper to be the star of our project instead of Nao as Pepper, being 4 feet tall would grab more attention and/or be more 
                                    intimidating to users who may want to try beating the system.
                                    <br><br>
                                    <center><img style="display: inline;" class="img-responsive" src="../img/coding.png" alt="" width="70%" height="70%" /></center><br>
                                    <br>
                                    We implemented Pepper to use voice communication and used its Facial Recognition API extensively to help it register faces, assign temporary 
                                    passes to visitors till 11 pm (after-hours) and made it handle cases where either the user may not be looking directly at Pepper or refuse to 
                                    cooperate and try to tresspass, in which case Pepper will register the tresspasser's face and notify the security office.
                                    <center><img style="display: inline;" class="img-responsive" src="../img/usability.png" alt="" width="70%" height="70%" /></center><br>
                                    <br>
                                    We conducted usability tests and realised that users probably don't know when to respond to Pepper (too early or too late). We later added 
                                    extra cues for Pepper so that users would answer Pepper's questions after a beep etc.

                                Our team as a whole, if I can speak for my team, enjoyed the POV process as it gave us an opportunity to use a trending technology solution and 
                                empathize with users problems and try addressing their needs. We started understanding what users felt about robots and ideated so that our users'
                                concerns were our top priority. It was really fun interacting with Pepper along the way and Pepper never failed to entertain us! Although we came up 
                                with many scenarios where Pepper could be used, the hall guard solution, although the least complicated, was actually the best as it was the most complete 
                                and addressed the right questions that users had about proper hall entry regulations and efficiency. We feel our solution is a step towards a smooth 
                                tech-enabled campus life here at HKUST.
